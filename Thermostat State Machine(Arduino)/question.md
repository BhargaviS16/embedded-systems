Implement your Arduino-based thermostat state machine.
Connect 3 LEDs to PORTB to indicate the (off/on) state of the cooling compressor, heating element, and indoor fan used to circulate air.
Assume a set temperature of 70 degrees.
Use the serial monitor to get the current temperature from the user. 
Compare the current temperature to the set temperature to determine the next state of your Arduino-based implementation.
